Requirements in tic-tac-toe have changed.

1. There is a new requirement: you have to play againt AI (not against yourself).
Use chatGPT to implement this change (the response can be random)

2. You have already existing tests. Many tests will fail. Writing tests will become harder.
Modify your tests to cover this new requirements. Think if what you are testing can be easily broken?

Think that later on i might ask you to change the size of the board. If they do would pass, think how to modify those.

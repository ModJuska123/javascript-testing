In your last homework you have 2 endpoints:
GET Transactions and Create Transaction.

Please add Jest and Supertest tests to test these endpoints.
Use ChatGPT to generate these tests, but please understand what the code does.
The tests should be runnable with command 'npm run test'

You should check that status code is returned correct, and the body of the result is what you expect.

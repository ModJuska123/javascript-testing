You already have a node.js express application for Shop and ShopItem management.
The repo also contains PostmanCollection to test these calls.

1. I should be able to run tests with 'npm run test'.
This means i should have a dev dependency to newman.

2. 'npm run test:report' should generate an htmlextra report.
Report should not be committed to repo. (.gitignore should be updated)

3. Try using Postman Variables and environments. BaseUrl should be an environment variable.
This will require to export environment as a file as well.

Nothing should be installed with -g

4. Extra Optional.
You need a running application to run your tests succesfully.
You can launch the application and run the tests by using npm package 'concurrently'
https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently
You can launch server and tests with a single command.
If you have other that you prefer use that.

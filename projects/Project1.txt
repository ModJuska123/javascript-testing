You will create an automated Postman test framework using Postman, newman and Github actions.

1. Please create a CRUD application to manage movie-store.
Movie can have a title, production-date, producer and rating

2. Postman should have tests for two business cases

1. I am able to create and remove a movie. (Use GET by id after the movie was removed)
2. I am able to get a movie by id and successfully update its rating.

3. There should be a github action, which i can click and run all these scenario tests.
